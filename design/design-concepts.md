I was inspired by several "boxy" designs I found on CSS Zen Garden. 
I'm going to sound like a borken record but I love clean simple design, and find 
that a websites, and CSS Zen Garden designs that I instantly gravitated towards were very minimalistic,
simple, and not very taxing on the eyes.  For the wireframe I wanted to separate each section into a differetnt box, 
and have the user scroll down the website and read each section, seperated by indivual boxes in different colors. While I couldn't
get it exactly like the wireframe I think the end result came close. Each section is divided and enclosed within its own box, with the exception
of the last two, which I thought looked better merged. I made some boxes transparent to give it a more natural feel.
